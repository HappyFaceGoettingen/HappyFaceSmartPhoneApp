# HappyFace Mobile Application V.1 branch developed by Fabian Kukuck.
## Requirements to build Apk
1. Ionic 1.6.1
2. Cordova 6.0.0

## Some TODOs for future
1. HappyFace URLs are hard-coded. (Only GoeGrid and KIT are available in Oct., 2017. The others do not exist any more.)
2. Only classical rating in HF is visible.
3. As an interface for an administration, the function is powerless and poor.
4. And as for 3, it needs extra workflows (for example, opening browsers, understanding situations, connecting to terminals and so on).
